Project 4: Wordle
Reference Pages used:
11/8/23 - 11/_/23
Date:11/8/23
Notes: Mostly just research: Use pg 778, pg 681 (must use lists and classes) THOUGHT: to keep track of their attempts
use pg 683 and imagine it as words.add("x"); x being the users input and count how many words are in the string to
keep track of how many words they have tried as all of them will be added to the list then maybe make a loop around
it that if the list reaches five words then game over and the user fails and can either rest game but like have
 another word the next time round
or just hit enter and be done
