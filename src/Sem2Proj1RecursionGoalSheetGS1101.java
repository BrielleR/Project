    - CH12:748     Complete so far 0/7: found notes for 3/7

starts off with user input times it to the nth power outputs runs again subtracts initial input by 1 then put s it to the nth power and outputs next line, until initial input is 0
        (pg 750 lets you out put specific number of 'stars' each time in number place input the letter represent number of stars to the nth power, pg762, talks about math pow for have ints to the nth power, pg 765  helps with making squares & handling errors,
