Problem GS10-02 - writeSquares  (BJP Ch 12 Ex 6)
    - "Write a recursive method called writeSquares that accepts an integer parameter n and prints the first n squares
    separated by commas, with the odd squares in descending order followed by the even squares in ascending order.
    For example, writeSquares(8); prints the following output:49, 25, 9, 1, 4, 16, 36, 64 (BJP Ch 12 Ex 6)"

    - CH12:748     Complete so far 0/7:

public static int pow(int x, int y) {
if (y < 0) {
throw new IllegalArgumentException("negative exponent: " + y);
} else if (y == 0) {
// base case with y == 0
return 1;
} else if (y % 2 == 0) {
// recursive case with y > 0, y even
return pow(x * x, y / 2);
} else {
// recursive case with y > 0, y odd
return x * pow(x, y â€“ 1);
}
}
        (pg 764  helps with making squares & handling errors, pg 94/148/203/273/336 helps with identifying odd or even,pg __ helps with sorting squares
-837, split array into two halves and sort each then merge back together
Date:2/13/24
Notes:First of 7 parts for Proj 1, due in 16 days, first need to make it so takes user input and squares it, then sorts it the greatest even to the least even then greatest odd to the least even,
