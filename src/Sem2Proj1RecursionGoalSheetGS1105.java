Fibonacci (GS11-05)(BJP Ch 12 Problem 16) (more efficient recursive)
    - The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers in which the first two numbers are 1 and each subsequent number
    is the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers. The sequence is 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on. Write
    a new version of the method given in the book that is still recursive and has the same header but is more efficient.
     Do this by creating a helper method that accepts additional parameters, such as previous Fibonacci numbers, that
     you can carry through and modify during each recursive call. (BJP Ch 12 Problem 16) Fibonacci another way (more efficiently)
