writeSequence (GS11-03)(BJP Ch 12 Ex 3)
    - Write a recursive method called writeSequence that accepts an integer n as a parameter and prints to the console
     a symmetric sequence of n numbers composed of descending integers that ends in 1, followed by a sequence of
     ascending integers that begins with 1. When n is odd, the sequence has a single 1 in the middle, but when n is
     even, it has two 1s in the middle. Throw an IllegalArgumentException if it is passed a value less than 1. (BJP Ch 12 Ex 3)
